Problem Statement: Image classification on Tiny Imagenet dataset using a custom CNN and a Feed-Forward neural network. Problem Description: Take 500-1000 images from the Tiny Imgenet dataset. Pick at least ten different categories. Make sure that you pick the same number of images from each category. Use a custom CNN network and a Feedforward Network for the classification. Compare the results.

Summary of the results: As instructed we took 1000 images of 10 categories from the Tiny Imagenet dataset with 100 images per category and split that into 80% training, 10% validation and 10% testing data. Then we developed a custom CNN and a feed-forward neural network to compare the results. We took batch size of 100 to train the models. First we evaluated the custom CNN model which yielded 94% training accuracy with a loss of 0.1864 and 64% validation accuracy with a loss of 1.406. As for the testing accuracy, this custom CNN model was 82% accurate with a loss of 0.7452. Now to compare, we developed a feed-forward neural network which yielded 63% training accuracy with a loss of 1.0262 and 34% validation accuracy with a loss of 1.7310. And as for the testing accuracy, this feed-forward neural network was 51% accurate with a loss of 1.4382. These numbers and the contents of this notebook shows that for image classification of multiple classes CNN is much superior than feed-forward neural network.
